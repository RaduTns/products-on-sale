# Products-on-Sale
### Small app that will help me find which products are on sale and where based on a list of desired products. The purpose is to be notified as soon as possible of discounts, without wasting the time to check catalogs. My target is Supermarket Catalogs for now 
- Focus at the moment is on OCR extraction, specifically Product-Price association(done at the moment via groq)
- Trying to integrate Supabase
- A web-interface would be nice, but that will be my last concern
